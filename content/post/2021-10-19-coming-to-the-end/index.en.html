<p>I have under a month left of my SPL. It has genuinely flown by - I really can’t believe it. I think it is a mixture of everything; spending time with Joel, the weekly routine, having time with Kirsten after school, seeing her develop and mature enormously (especially these first few weeks in Year 1), Natalie being extremely busy with work, a few trips here and there with grandparents and wider family, and me being off work and not having to worry about it at all. It really has been a very happy few months for me (and hopefully the rest of the family). I will miss it. If any would-be Dads come across this post and are considering SPL, I really really can’t stress how great it is and that the opportunity should be taken,</p>
<p>Once of the big differences between SPL and Daddy-daycare we’ve noticed in the past couple of months is that in SPL I have the main responsibility of everything around Joel. It’s a small point, but feels important to me. Previously, I may have taken Kirsten out for a day, or for some time, but I would need information about timings for sleep, when she’d need feeding, nappies etc etc. Because I spend so much time with Joel the roles are reversed. It means I don’t feel like second fiddle.</p>
