title: "Shared parental leave"
---

Welcome to my blog. I'm trying to put together a diary/some memories of the few weeks that I have off work and spend with Joel while doing Shared Parental Leave.

Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is fairly new and not so commonly taken at the moment, but it is an amazing opportunity for parents to share time with their newborns, but also a way to reduce/mitigate the impact on the careers of mothers on having a child. 

I will write more about this in a blog and our experiences of organising SPL, but for now, enjoy my ramblings
