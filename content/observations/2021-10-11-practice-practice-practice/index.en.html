<p>Joel loves to master a skill. When he learnt to control his fingers he loved to pick things up. His hand would approach whatever it was he’s picking up with his index finger extended, then his finger would curl around his object of desire, which would then come towards his mouth. He could stick at this activity for quite a long time.</p>
<p>So there are a skills he likes to master like this. His current favourites are hitting balloons (as it was Kirsten’s birthday party a couple of weeks ago we have lots of balloons), and learning how to walk. The video below is Joel practicing walking - it was filmed over 2 minutes (sped up). He can do this for ages without interruption…</p>
