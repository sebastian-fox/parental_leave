<p>Ok, so Joel doesn’t crawl or dance yet. He’s 9 months old tomorrow (it has flown by by the way!), and he still doesn’t move very far from the spot that he’s left. He sits very nicely, and in the last week he has decided that the things that are left within his small catchment area aren’t good enough. To overcome this he has learnt to rock forward, then get to a knee plank position, before lunging for the thing he wants. This adds an extra 30-40cm to his reach, which is great for him. Though once he has got what he wants, which is rare because generally he’ll parry it further from his reach, he can’t do much with it as he is stuck. He’s so close to moving though, so this is a temporary issue.</p>
<p>Another new thing is dancing. He doesn’t particularly respond to baby music that we hear in the music class we go to, but he quite likes a bit of pop music. See the picture below of when I caught him listening to something and having a good rock back and forth to it.</p>
