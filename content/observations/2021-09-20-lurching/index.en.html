<p>There are a handful of things that Joel will lurch from your arms to reach when passing them:</p>
<ul>
<li>the non-functional doorbell in our porch. To be more precise, it is the screw that is holding the doorbell to the frame</li>
<li>the electric point that we charge our car from. Heâ€™s yet to touch this though (and hopefully never will!)</li>
<li>Mummy - when I open her study door to say hello while she is working. He throws a big smile then tries to jump from my hands</li>
</ul>
