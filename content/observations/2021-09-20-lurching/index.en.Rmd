There are a handful of things that Joel will lurch from your arms to reach when passing them:

* the non-functional doorbell in our porch. To be more precise, it is the screw that is holding the doorbell to the frame
* the electric point that we charge our car from. He's yet to touch this though (and hopefully never will!)
* Mummy - when I open her study door to say hello while she is working. He throws a big smile then tries to jump from my hands

Other big ticket items to mention are:

* Kirsten - Joel's beaming face will light up the room when he notices Kirsten for the first time
* Squishmallow dinosaur - a round green dinosaur Joel loves when he sees it
