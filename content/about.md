title: "About me"
---

I'm Seb. I'm late 30s. I have two children now, one who is almost 6 called Kirsten, and one who is now 8 months old called Joel.

I work in Public Health as a Data Scientist. I love programming in R, but I want to start branching out a bit more. One day I will find the time to do this.

I love most sport, and when I have time I play tennis. I am driven by inequalities and injustices. I am constantly torn in my career whether I should be using my skills to improve the balance of health outcomes between different parts of society, or should I be doing more towards helping mitigate climate change?!

That's me.
